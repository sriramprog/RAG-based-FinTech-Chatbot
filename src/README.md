# Notebooks

This folder contains exploratory and development notebooks used to build and optimize an interactive RAG-based financial document question-answering system.

The notebooks are organized as modular stages of the document intelligence pipeline, progressing from document ingestion and OCR to retrieval optimization, multi-document routing, and end-to-end system integration.

### Document Ingestion & OCR
- **Project 4 – OCR Analysis**
  - Analyze scanned financial PDFs
  - Compare OCR engines for accuracy and layout preservation

### Retrieval & Embedding Foundations
- **Project 5 – Retrieval Optimization**
  - Query processing experiments
  - Chunking and embedding strategies using LlamaIndex
  - Core RAG retrieval pipeline construction

### Advanced Retrieval & Routing
- **Project 6 – RAG Optimization Experiments**
  - Embedding and retrieval configuration comparisons

- **Project 7 – Document Segmentation & Query Routing**
  - Page-level metadata extraction
  - Multi-document and intra-document query routing

### End-to-End System
- **Project 8 / 9 – Interactive RAG UI**
  - Full pipeline integration
  - User-facing question-answering interface

These notebooks prioritize technical exploration and system design over production-ready code.
