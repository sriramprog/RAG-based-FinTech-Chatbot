# Notebooks

This folder contains exploratory, experimental, and development notebooks used to build and optimize the RAG-based financial document question-answering system.

The notebooks are organized as incremental modules, each focusing on a specific stage of the document intelligence pipeline—from OCR and document preprocessing to retrieval optimization, query routing, and full RAG system construction.

### Covered Topics
- OCR analysis and comparison across scanned financial documents
- Semantic chunking and embedding strategies
- Retrieval optimization and query processing
- Metadata extraction and document segmentation
- Multi-document and intra-document query routing
- End-to-end RAG pipeline construction and evaluation

### Notes
- Earlier notebooks reuse a consistent set of pre-approved financial documents (e.g., mortgage letters, pay stubs, offer letters) across different experimental contexts.
- Later notebooks focus on system integration and interactive RAG UI development.
- Outputs, intermediate results, and observations are embedded directly within the notebooks to support interpretability and reproducibility.

These notebooks are intended to demonstrate technical depth, iterative experimentation, and applied decision-making rather than polished production code.
