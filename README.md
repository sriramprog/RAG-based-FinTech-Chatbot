## Executive Summary
Financial teams often need fast, reliable answers from complex documents such as statements, agreements, and lender forms. However, extracting the right information typically requires manual review and repeated lookups. This project built an interactive, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to upload finance-related PDFs and ask natural-language questions to instantly retrieve grounded answers from the document content. The system converts unstructured documents into a searchable knowledge layer using OCR and semantic retrieval, then generates responses that are anchored to the source text for transparency. The goal was to reduce time spent on document review, improve consistency in Q&A, and demonstrate a scalable approach to AI-assisted financial document understanding for Outamation’s document automation workflows.

### Business Problem
The primary goal was to reduce the time, effort, and risk associated with extracting answers from unstructured financial documents used in routine and ad hoc decision-making. Finance and operations teams rely on long, inconsistently formatted PDFs that are difficult to search, requiring manual scanning, contextual interpretation, and repeated verification across pages. This process does not scale with document volume and increases the likelihood of missed details or inconsistent responses when timely answers are needed in document-driven workflows.

### Methodology
1. [Step 1 – data ingestion / document parsing]
2. [Step 2 – chunking / embeddings / vector DB]
3. [Step 3 – retrieval + prompt + response generation]
4. [Step 4 – evaluation + iteration / improvements]
